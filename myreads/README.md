# MyReads Project

This is the third project for Udacity's Full-Stack-JS-Developer.

With the MyReads app you can divide books into 3 categories "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read". A search page lets you search for more books and add them to categories.

## Install

1. clone this repo 'https://github.com/Horndt/reactnd-project-myreads.git'
2. navigate in your terminal to the `myreads` directory
3. install all project dependencies with `npm install`

## Run

- start the server with `npm start`

## Stop

- `CTRL + C` and confirm with `Y`

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the final project for Udacity's React course. Therefore, i will not accept pull requests.
